WProofreader plugin TinyMCE
===================================

The multilingual spelling and grammar checking solution for TinyMCE editor versions starting from v6, including the latest version 7. It provides both instant and in-dialog proofreading modes in a convenient UI. 

WProofreader plugin for TinyMCE inherits all functionality of the WProofreader component with slight adaptation to the view and features of the editor. These adaptations include creating a button in the editor toolbar, listening for read-only mode switches and adding a theme adapted to the TinyMCE look and feel.
